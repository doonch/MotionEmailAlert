# MotionEmailAlert
Set up your old laptop as a security camera. When motion is detected, get an encrypted email notification with a snapshot.

# Why?
Monitor a sensitive room or yard for any unauthorized entry. Track your pets, bird nests, etc. 

But really, I just wanted someone to send me PGP encrypted emails.

Either way, here it is.
